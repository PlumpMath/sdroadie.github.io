    <p>So, a few months ago, I built a website for a family friend. Word got around that I knew a thing or two about building websites, so I obliged. I wasn’t working on anything huge (this was the end of the summer).</p>

<p>The task was relatively simple: build a simple photography site. The aforementioned family friend was trying to start a side business, and wanted a place to show his portfolio to would-be clients.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was sit down with him to flesh out what exactly he was looking for. “Something clean and simple.” I’d never built anything more than simple front-end stuff. I figured it wouldn’t be too difficult and wire up a backend. So I started looking into CMS options. The first one I stumbled upon and stuck with was Wordpress.</p>

<p>It seemed like a sound decision. Wordpress has one of the largest communities around, is mature and feature-packed, and has a nice, intuitive interface. The last item was really the reason that I stuck with it: I didn’t want to be responsible for adding new pictures for him all the time.</p>

<p>So on I went, trying to develop the site. It was a bit confusing at first. I’d never touched PHP, and the whole theme thing was off putting. It felt like I was losing a lot of control over how things were working. There was a lot of “magic”. I don’t like that. As much as is realistically possible, I like understanding the systems I use. This wasn’t really the case. I thought it would take a few days, but suddenly I had this whole system I was compelled to understand.</p>

<p>First thing I did was search the web for Wordpress tutorials. First place I stumbled upon was the Wordpress Codex. Great resource, but I didn’t have the time to read through all of that. I kinda wanted someone to whisk me through the basics, just enough so that I could get on my way. I ended up going through a tutorial on <a href="http://themeshaper.com">ThemeShaper</a>. By the end, I didn’t really understand what was going on. I just had all of this code that was doing… something. So I moved on.</p>

<p>At the time, I had a membership to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. I would highly recommend it. They do a wonderful job of breaking down the concepts behind most Web technologies. However, as someone who was already somewhat familiar with this stuff, the pacing seemed slow at parts.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to my story. I took the Wordpress tutorial on the site, and while it was pretty high level, it was the first time I started to understand what was going on. “Time to build a theme from scratch!”, I thought.</p>

<p>I was <strong>wrong</strong>. You should never, ever do anything from scratch these days except for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>What you need simply doesn’t exist, and you’re innovating.</li>

<li>Licensing is getting in your way.</li>

<li>You need to learn.</li>
</ol>

<p>I <strong>wanted</strong> to learn, but I <strong>needed</strong> to deliver a product. After a few more Google searches, I found the <a href="http://underscores.me">Underscores Theme</a>. And it was exactly what I needed! A simple, minimal Wordpress theme that took care of all the basic stuff, but still allowed me to make the theme what I needed. I took it and ran.</p>

<p>Along the way, I discovered other awesome libraries: <a href="http://mixitup.io">MixItUp</a> and <a href="lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox2</a>. I used the two libraries to create a single portfolio page where viewers can filter and sort pictures as they wished. I think the result was pretty nice.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from this project. In this day and age, you rarely have to start from scratch. The open source community is huge and awesome and can help you solve nearly every problem you have. All you have to do is search and ask. You can check the site out <a href="http://michael-allan-photo.com">here</a>. If you have critiques, please email me, not Mike. He didn’t build it. It’s not the best thing in the world, but I made it, and I’m proud of it. My next site will be even better.</p>

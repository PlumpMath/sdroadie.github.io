My muse,
what a deception you've allowed yourself
to swallow whole.
Did you think I'd really give up?

Put down all my war machines and
walk away?
Look at the wake of destruction that we've left.

Earth scorched,
lakes turned to salt.
Is this what you want?
Surrender and dying earth?

We could work out a truce.
Form a convenant under which
we could coexist
peacefully.

Reason was never your strong suit
but I never expected you
to abandon everything
and run.

Perhaps I never examined you fully
and didn't realize
from the start,
you had won.

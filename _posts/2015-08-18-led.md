This should feel tighter.
This envelope
Of darkness and warmth
But it is fleeting.

A small light on a strange device beckons
pulling me from pleasant dreams to worldly concerns.
Events unfolding far away, 
at the edges of natural perception.

Yet they tear you away from the shapeless void of slumber
unlikely to release.

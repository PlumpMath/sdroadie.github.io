Clear skies for miles
but not a sight to see.
Tongue burned and blinded
by the hotel coffee.

Not half a world away from home
yet it feels like another planet.
So much space and time to fill,
how do the locals manage?

Probably pessimistic
or simply expecting more
from life and all the places
that I get to tour.

Maybe I should just sit back,
and soak up what I can.
It's only a few days
til I'm back in Maryland.

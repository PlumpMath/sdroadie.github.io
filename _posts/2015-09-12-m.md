Ghost of my imagination
Or at least
the spawn of my own mind

Tethered behind me
lashed in ropes and chains.

Crumbling under the weight
that I've forced so heavily
on their hinds and legs.

Begging them
to keep pushing.

My weight,
claustrophobic as it makes you
will dissipate
if you keep pushing

And pushing.
I didn't say stop.
I don't know what you thought.

That the human hurricane
which you stumbled upon
would just cease
because of how hard things became?

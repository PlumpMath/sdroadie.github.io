Hold this thread.
TIGHTER!
You're doing it
wrong.
Why can't you help
me?!

Fixing your broken bones
and bruises
with stitches
and gauze.

**I** know what I'm doing.
Making you
like me.
A better version,
next year's model 
today.

Stand up straight.
Smile
more.
You're less malleable 
than clay
but keep
pushing
until this
breaks.

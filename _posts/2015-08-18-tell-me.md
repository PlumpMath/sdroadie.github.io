Tell me again, how is your pain more significant?

How is it more transcendent?

Whisper to me.

How do you feel more than do?
How are you more sensitive?

Please flash before my eyes,
why do despise me for going through what I do?

Why is your experience more relevant?
What about you makes it more true?

Who are you to accuse me of making up feeling full,
inflating my emotions?

Maybe everything happening to you
is happening in a bubble of your own invention.

Perhaps everything you felt is a result
of your acting and intention.

I refuse to produce an apology and
recompense for that I feel truly.

Maybe you should examine inside yourself
and find why you feel empty.

Try to devise a plan  to
command the life that you want
from what you've been handed.

Provide a land that makes you feel
fulfilled, complete, accepted, ready.

Ready to escape the world,
escape the trail that you spin in endlessly.

Find a plan to release your goals
from the languid gentry.

Perhaps you were never what you wanted to be,
but why impose that on me?
The need to be someone I am can't be,
a manufactured shadow of reality.

Let go, try to relax, sit back.
Let it happen as it will.

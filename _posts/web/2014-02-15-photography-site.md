So, a few months ago, I built a website for a family friend. Word got around
that I knew a thing or two about building websites, so I obliged. I wasn't
working on anything huge (this was the end of the summer).

The task was relatively simple: build a simple photography site. The
aforementioned family friend was trying to start a side business,
and wanted a place to show his portfolio to would-be clients.

The first thing I did was sit down with him to flesh out what exactly he was
looking for. "Something clean and simple." I'd never built anything more than
simple front-end stuff. I figured it wouldn't be too difficult and wire up a
backend. So I started looking into CMS options. The first one I stumbled upon
and stuck with was Wordpress.

It seemed like a sound decision. Wordpress has one of the largest communities
around, is mature and feature-packed, and has a nice, intuitive interface.
The last item was really the reason that I stuck with it: I didn't want to be
responsible for adding new pictures for him all the time.

So on I went, trying to develop the site. It was a bit confusing at first. I'd
never touched PHP, and the whole theme thing was off putting. It felt like I was
losing a lot of control over how things were working. There was a lot of
"magic". I don't like that. As much as is realistically possible, I like
understanding the systems I use. This wasn't really the case. I thought it would
take a few days, but suddenly I had this whole system I was compelled to
understand.

First thing I did was search the web for Wordpress tutorials. First place I
stumbled upon was the Wordpress Codex. Great resource, but I didn't have the
time to read through all of that. I kinda wanted someone to whisk me through the
basics, just enough so that I could get on my way. I ended up going through a
tutorial on [ThemeShaper](http://themeshaper.com). By the end, I didn't really
understand what was going on. I just had all of this code that was doing...
something. So I moved on.

At the time, I had a membership to [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com). I
would highly recommend it. They do a wonderful job of breaking down the concepts
behind most Web technologies. However, as someone who was already somewhat
familiar with this stuff, the pacing seemed slow at parts.

Anyway, back to my story. I took the Wordpress tutorial on the site, and while
it was pretty high level, it was the first time I started to understand what was
going on. "Time to build a theme from scratch!", I thought.

I was **wrong**. You should never, ever do anything from scratch these days
except for three reasons:
1. What you need simply doesn't exist, and you're innovating.
2. Licensing is getting in your way.
3. You need to learn.

I **wanted** to learn, but I **needed** to deliver a product. After a few more
Google searches, I found the [Underscores Theme](http://underscores.me). And it was
exactly what I needed! A simple, minimal Wordpress theme that took care of all
the basic stuff, but still allowed me to make the theme what I needed. I took it
and ran.

Along the way, I discovered other awesome libraries: [MixItUp](http://mixitup.io)
and [Lightbox2](lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/). I used the two libraries
to create a single portfolio page where viewers can filter and sort pictures as
they wished. I think the result was pretty nice.

I learned a lot from this project. In this day and age, you rarely have to start
from scratch. The open source community is huge and awesome and can help you
solve nearly every problem you have. All you have to do is search and ask. You
can check the site out [here](http://michael-allan-photo.com). If you have
critiques, please email me, not Mike. He didn't build it. It's not the best
thing in the world, but I made it, and I'm proud of it. My next site will be
even better.

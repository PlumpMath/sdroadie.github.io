Hey there! My name's Jeremy. I'm a software developer from Baltimore.
I'm just about to graduate from UMBC with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I love building software, using the best tool for the job. Most of my work
has been in Python and Ruby, but I'm currently branching out. My current
interest is Clojure. It's so expressive and powerful.

I'm currently looking for employment in the Baltimore area, preferably in
the city.

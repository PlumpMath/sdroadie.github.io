Hey there! My name's Jeremy. I'm a software developer from Baltimore.
I recently graduated from the University Of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)
with a B.S. in Computer Science. I love building software, using the best tool for the job. Most of my work has been in Python, Ruby and Javascript,
but I'm currently branching out. My current interest is Clojure. It's so
expressive and powerful. I'm also exploring Haskell and OCaml.

I'm currently a Faculty Research Assistant at UMBC's [Imaging Research Center](http://irc.umbc.edu). I work on various web and mobile applications for
faculty members as well as outside organizations. Check out some of our work!

An awesome cafe opened up near me recently. I go there a lot. One day, they were selling
mugs that allow you to get $1 coffees forever. Couldn't resist. They're also really nice
mugs. The artisan that makes them has a really cool logo. Looks like this.

<div class="canvas-container" id="logo-complete"></div>

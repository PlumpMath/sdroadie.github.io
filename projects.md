Here are various projects I've worked on.

[Sherman's March](http://shermansmarch.org): An HTML5 application, built with
the [CreateJS](http://www.createjs.com) library. Ported from Flash.

[NAS Dome Explorer](http://nasdome.com): An augmented reality application
for the iPad. Ported from XCode to Unity3d.

[Deku](http://github.com/sdroadie/deku): A semester project from my Software
Engineering course. Used [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) to build a small social network aimed at students.
